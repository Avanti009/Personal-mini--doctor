      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Avanti Ashok Bhondwe, a student on a mission to blend healthcare with technology in the coolest way possible. 🌟</p>

      <h3>My Vision</h3>
      <p>Imagine a world where healthcare is as easy as checking your Instagram feed! That’s my goal—making health info accessible, fun, and totally within reach. 🚀</p>

      <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
      <p>Just a tech-savvy student with a passion for healthcare and a knack for creating awesome stuff! With a bit of coding magic and a lot of enthusiasm, I've set out to make health tech both useful and entertaining.</p>

      <h3>My Mission</h3>
      <p>My mission is to create a platform where you can quickly figure out what might be ailing you, and also have a bit of fun while doing it. With the power of AI and machine learning, you’ll get spot-on predictions and helpful tips, all in a user-friendly package.</p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>I've built a machine learning model that’s been trained on a ton of data to help you understand your symptoms. Just tell it what’s bugging you, and voilà—instant insights!</p>

      <h3>Your Health, My Priority</h3>
      <p>Health can be complicated, but your journey doesn't have to be. My goal is to provide clear info and practical tips that’ll help you feel better and stay informed. Plus, who says health tech can’t be a bit of fun? 💪</p>
